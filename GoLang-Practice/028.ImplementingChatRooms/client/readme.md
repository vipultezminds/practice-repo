This Go code is a chat client that connects to a chat server over a TCP connection. The client allows users to sign up, log in, retrieve chat history, send and receive messages, and perform other chat-related functions. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. **Imports**:
   ```go
   import (
      "bufio"
      "encoding/json"
      "fmt"
      "net"
      "os"
      "regexp"
      "strings"
      "gitlab.com/david_mbuvi/go_asterisks"
   )
   ```
   These are the necessary Go packages used in the code. Notably, it imports the `gitlab.com/david_mbuvi/go_asterisks` package for password input with hidden characters.

2. **UserInfo Struct**:
   ```go
   type UserInfo struct {
      Fullname       string `json:"fullname"`
      Bio            string `json:"bio"`
      Role           string `json:"role"`
      SignupDateTime string `json:"signupDateTime"`
      IsActive       bool   `json:"isActive"`
      LastSeen       string `json:"LastSeen"`
   }
   ```
   This is a struct used to parse user information from JSON responses received from the server. It represents user details such as Fullname, Bio, Role, Signup Date and Time, Activity status (IsActive), and Last Seen.

3. **main() Function**:
   - The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
   - It establishes a connection to the chat server running on `localhost:8080`.
   - The program uses a `reader` to read user input.

4. **Signup and Login**:
   - Users are given the option to either sign up or log in. This choice is taken using the `option` variable.
   - **Signup**: Users are prompted to enter their username, password, full name, bio, and role. A password policy is enforced using a regular expression to ensure it's at least 8 characters and contains a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. If the password is valid, a signup request is sent to the server.
   - **Login**: Users enter their username and password (hidden with asterisks). A login request is sent to the server.

5. **Read Messages and Send Messages**:
   - If the login is successful, users can choose to read or send messages:
     - Reading messages is done by spawning a goroutine to continuously read and display messages from the server.
     - Sending messages prompts users for input, which is sent to the server.

6. **Retrieve and Display Chat History**:
   - Users can retrieve and display chat history. There are two options:
     - "Retrieve All Chat History": Requests all chat history from the server.
     - "Retrieve Chat History by User": Requests chat history for a specific user. This history is displayed as it's received from the server.

7. **Retrieve User Information**:
   - Users can retrieve information about a specific user by entering their username. A request is sent to the server, and the server responds with JSON data, which is then parsed and displayed to the user.

8. **Check User Online**:
   - Users can check if a specific user is online by entering their username. A request is sent to the server, and the server responds with the online status (or last seen if offline).

9. **Private Messaging**:
   - Users can send and receive private messages. This involves separate functions for reading and sending private messages. The user is prompted to enter the recipient's username, and they can send messages back and forth privately.


This code is for a chat client that interacts with a chat server, allowing users to sign up, log in, and perform various chat-related operations. The code is structured to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the server, and it uses goroutines to handle asynchronous tasks like reading messages while allowing users to send messages. It also leverages regular expressions for secure password validation and parses JSON data from the server to display user information.
